  <title>Introduction to SVR4-style Tools</title>

  <sect2>
    <title>What is SVR4?</title>

    <para>
      SVR4, or System V Release 4, is a version of System V, ie. Unix. The tools
      in this chapter aim to help working with such an environment on an LFS
      system. There are a few caveats as a result of dealing with an old
      operating system.

    <title>Paths</title>

    <para>
      The packages in this chapter are installed to various non-standard
      locations inside <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>. The purpose
      behind this is to be more accurate to where UNIXen from where these tools
      were ported put said files, and an explanation of where said paths came
      from is provided below.
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <filename class="directory">/bin</filename> and
          <filename class="directory">/sbin</filename>: the traditional,
          pre-dating formal standardization, general toolsets; from a
          post-formal-standardization viewpoint, commands that conform to the
          System V Interface Definition and the X/Open Portability Guide
          version 3 (or, in Linux's case, standard Linux tools)
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <filename class="directory">/usr/ucb</filename>: UCB (i.e. BSD)
          compatibility directory with BSD-compatible tools
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <filename class="directory">/5bin</filename> and
          <filename class="directory">/usr/5bin</filename>: System V (i.e. 5)
          compatibility directory with AT&amp;T Unix System 5 compatible tools
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <filename class="directory">/usr/ccs/bin</filename>: various
          developer tools
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <filename class="directory">/usr/sadm/bin</filename>: pkgadd internal
          tooling
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      The rest of the non-standard folders' meanings can be easily deduced from
      basic Linux knowledge and the above.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you want to know more about old UNIXen' path conventions, and are
      willing to fall down a rabbit hole of 80s-90s UNIX variants, DEC
      equipment and various other old UNIX conventions, old hardware and
      everyday jobs of UNIX sysops of the 90s, a much more comprehensive guide
      can be found

    <title>A note on Linux, UNIX SVR4 and BSD</title>

    <para>
      It is also of note that Linux tools are much closer in UI and parameters
      to their BSD counterparts than their SVR4 ones. If you want to use tools
      from this category on a daily basis and you're not familiar with UNIX
      SVR4, you might first need to learn how SVR4 tools work.
