# Binary

This section is dedicated to installing packages that help aid you to download,
run, and execute binaries that you have not compiled yourself. The following
packages will help you get this support:

- [Fuse2](./1-fuse2.md) (for AppImages)
- [OSTree](./2-ostree.md) (for Flatpak)
- [Flatpak](./3-flatpak.md) (runs binaries in a sandbox)
