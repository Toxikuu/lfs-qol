  <title>Preface</title>

  <para>
    There are a number of packages that don't quite belong in the LFS books
    (LFS, MLFS, BLFS, or GLFS). However, some packages can be confusing to
    install beyond these books, sometimes requiring multiple patches to even
    build, or the setup is confusing.
  </para>

  <para>
    This book is meant to solve this very issue, essentially covering a
    different number of packages that should have a guide but don't belong in
    the LFS books.
