  <title>Foreword</title>

  <para>
    This book is meant to be followed after LFS. It is highly recommended to
    follow BLFS as well. This book depends on a lot of the packages in that
    book. You may optionally follow GLFS before this book as well, although
    all packages in this book should not need any lib32 build instructions.
    This means MLFS is not a requirement.
