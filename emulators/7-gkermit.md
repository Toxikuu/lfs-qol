## Installation of gkermit
The source distribution unpacks to the current directory. In order to avoid cluttering up the folder
where the tarball was originally downloaded to, unpack it in the following way:
```Bash
mkdir -v gkermit &&
cd gkermit &&
tar -zxvf ../gku201.tar.gz
```

Then, apply a patch to fix some implicit declarations leading to a build failure:
```Bash
patch -Np1 -i ../gkermit-2.01-fix-implicit-declaration.patch
```

Now, compile gkermit:
```Bash
rm -vf gproto.c &&
make
```

Now as the ***root*** user:
```Bash
make BINDIR=/usr/bin MANDIR=/usr/share/man/man1 TEXTDIR=/usr/share/doc/gkermit-2.01 install &&
mv -v /usr/share/man/man1/gkermit.l /usr/share/man/man1/gkermit.1
```

## Command Explanations
  `rm -vf gproto.c`: Get rid of a stray autogenerated file to ensure a working build.
