    <title>Security Vulnerabilities</title>

    <para>
      A security vulnerability, or a CVE, is a flaw in source code that can be
      used to harm the user(s) and/or the system in use, sometimes by abusing
      buffer overflows to achieve privilege escalation, modifying generated
      build scripts to use ssh at startup, or even messing with stale memory.
    </para>

    <para>
      There are many packages that push out updates that fix vulnerabilties,
      and some packages fix CVEs pretty often. LFS QOL will ocassionally have an
      update that upgrades a package that fixes a CVE. It's important to always
      upgrade packages on your system that contain security vulnerabilities,
      and there is a way for checking for those updates.

    <title>Checking for Security Updates</title>

    <para>
      To check for packages that have had a CVE fixed, go to the
      <ulink url="&lfs-qol-issues;?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue+label%3Asecurity">
      LFS QOL issue page</ulink> that has a filter enabled
      (<computeroutput>is:closed is:issue label:security</computeroutput>).
      All packages listed there that have the
      <computeroutput>security</computeroutput> label are packages that fixed
      a CVE in the version listed. Newer versions will be at the top of the
      list. When there are two versions of the same package, always go with the
      one that appears first in the list, or the top of it. Newer doesn't
      always mean safer, and it may sometimes be necessary to use an older
      version of a package, plus maybe a patch or two.
    </para>

    <para>
      Take note that the packages listed there are issues that have already
      been closed and are now in the book. You can go to the open section
      of the page to see if there are packages there that are still having
      details worked out and have yet to be fixed in the book. For most people,
      the closed section of the page is most important.
    </para>

    <para>
      Once you have found a package of note, you can go to the issue to see
      specific CVEs that were fixed. Once you have reviewed the ticket, you
      can then decide if you want to update the package listed. The most secure
      version is in the book unless a version of that package is in the open
      section of the page linked above.
