  <title>Getting the Source Packages</title>

  <para>Within the LFS QOL instructions, each package has two references for
  finding the source files for the package&mdash;an HTTP link and an FTP link
  (some packages may only list one of these links). Every effort has been made
  to ensure that these links are accurate. However, the World Wide Web is in
  continuous flux. Packages are sometimes moved or updated and the exact URL
  specified is not always available.</para>

  <para>We do not have a solution at the moment if a package download is
  unavailable besides going to the developer(s) and/or their website.</para>

    <title>Obtaining the Source Packages in Bulk</title>

    <para>
      Obtaining all the source packages all at once is not recommended as
      you will probably pull in packages you won't want. However, it is certainly
      a convenient option if you have the disk space to spare. First navigate to
      the directory you want the downloaded source code and patches to be, then
      download <ulink url="../wget-list">wget-list</ulink>. After that, download
      the packages and patches by doing the following:
